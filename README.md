Listed below are various coding projects I have completed so far. They include some simple, but functional, apps and websites, plus links to Free Code Camp JavaScript coding challenges and C code I wrote for CS50x problem sets.

The websites and apps are projects from Udemy and other online Web development courses. I learnt the required HTML, CSS and JavaScript using various resources, including TreeHouse, Udemy, w3Schools and MDN. The courses show you how to code the projects, but I coded each part myself first before watching how the instructor did it.

### 'Styles Conference' Website (static)

A project I created while working through Shay Howe's 'Learn to Code HTML & CSS' course. I chose to do this because I liked how the course was structured; you learn the theory on a subject, such as positioning, and then apply it to the website you are building. By the end of the course you've learnt the basics of HTML and CSS by building an actual site. I particularly liked his emphasis on using semantic HTMl, which I haven't encountered on other courses I've done.

### Reaction Tester Game

A simple project from a Udemy Web development course, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game requires you to click the randomly appearing shapes as quickly as possible. It taught me a lot about Math.random() and working with time intervals.

### RGB Color Game

A project from a Udemy Web development course, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game requires you to work out the correct color from the ratio of red, green and blue in the RGB number. This taught me a lot about event listeners and organizing code in functions.

### To-do List App

A project I did from a course called [watchandcode](http://watchandcode.com). It looks basic as there's no styling, but I found the project very useful for two reasons:
* It was designed to simulate how an app would be created in a commercial Agile environment. It started with a set of broad requirements that were refined into detailed requirements for each iteration of the app.
* It introduced me to the concept of JavaScript design patterns and showed me how to organise all my JS code within objects.

### RSVP App

A project I did on a TreeHouse DOM course. It's a simple app that allows you to enter invitee names, then edit them and filter by whether they've confirmed. It was very useful for learning about DOM manipulation, especially creating/appending/deleting elements and traversing the DOM. It was also useful to practice using ES2015 syntax.

### Dice Game

A project I did on a Udemy JavaScript course. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. Each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they want. Each result is added to their round score. But, if the player rolls a 1, all their round score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their round score is added to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn. The first player to reach 30 points global score wins the game. Players can manually enter a final score at any time to override the hard coded score.

The HTML and CSS was already written, but it was a useful learning exercise to create the JS and integrate it with the existing markup.

### JS Basic Algorithm Challenges (Free Code Camp)

A range of basic JavaScript coding challenges involving manipulation of numbers, strings and arrays. I tried to solve the challenges in two or three different ways, which involved researching different methods on w3schools and MDN.

### CS50x Problem Sets

Coding challenges from the first four problem sets of the Harvard Computer Science 50x MOOC. The course requires you to learn basic C syntax and grammar in order to attempt the problems. I worked through the problem sets to try and get a better grasp of fundamental programming principles.
