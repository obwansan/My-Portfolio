## Welcome to my current portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages

Listed below are various coding projects I have completed so far. They include some fully functional, but simple, apps and websites, plus links to C code I wrote for CS50x problem sets.

The websites and apps are projects from Udemy and other Web development courses. The courses walk you through them, but I coded each part myself first before checking how the instructor did it.

### Reaction Tester Game

This is a simple project from a Udemy Web development course, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game requires you to click the randomly appearing shapes as quickly as possible. It taught me a lot about Math.random() and working with time intervals.

### RGB Color Game

This is a project from a Udemy Web development course, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game requires you to work out the correct color from the ratio of red, green and blue in the RGB number. This taught me a lot about event listeners and organizing code in functions (rather than 'spaghetti code').

### To-do List App

This is a project I did from a course called [watchandcode](http://watchandcode.com). It looks basic as there's no styling, but I found the project very useful for two reasons:
1. It was designed to simulate how an app would be created in a commercial Agile environment. It started with a set of broad requirments that were refined into detailed requirements for each iteration.
1. It introduced me to the concept of JavaScript design patterns and showed me how to organise all my JS code within objects.

### RSVP App

This is a project I did on a TreeHouse DOM course. It's a simple app that allows you to enter invitee names, then edit them and filter by whether they've confirmed. It was very useful for learning about DOM manipulation, especially creating/appending/deleting elements and traversing the DOM. It also useful to practice with ES2016 syntax.
