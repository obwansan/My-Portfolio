## Welcome to my current portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages

Listed below are various coding projects I have completed so far. They include some fully functional, simple, apps and websites, plus links to C code I wrote for CS50x problem sets.

The websites and apps are projects from Udemy and other Web development courses. The courses walk you through how to create them, but I coded each part myself first before checking how the instructor did it, and then refactoring. 

### Reaction Tester Game

This is a simple project from a Udemy Web development course, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game requires you to click the randmoly appearing shapes as quickly as possible. It taught me a lot about Math.random() and working with time intervals.

### RGB Color Game

This is a project from a Udemy Web development course, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game requires you to work out the correct color from the ratio of red, green and blue in the RGB number. This taught me a lot about event listeners and organizing code in functions (rather than 'spaghetti code').
