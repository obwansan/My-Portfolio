## Welcome to my current portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages

Listed below are various coding projects I have completed so far. They include some fully functional, simple, apps and websites, plus links to C code I wrote for CS50x problem sets.

The websites and apps are projects from Udemy and other Web development courses. The courses walk you through how to create them, but I coded each part myself first before checking how the instructor did it, and then refactoring. 

### RGB Colour Game
